New files i've used are item.js route, views/item/listItem.handlebars, but i had to put createitem.handlebars 
in views/user. 

I edited main.js but the route for my listItem is in main.js. 

A few problems i have are that my item routes take the route from user.js instead of item.js, and that my 
list items take route from main.js. 


Also for the list of items, it shows a table but does not show any details in the table.
